# Overview
This project is a professional AI Systems Developer portfolio website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases an AI developer's transition into building intelligent automation systems, focusing on AI workflow engineering, Python systems building, and operational intelligence. The site features a strategic, role-aligned personal brand and includes a range of services, solution packages, and an advanced AI chatbot. The ambition is to provide a comprehensive and interactive platform for potential clients and collaborators, demonstrating expertise in modern AI and system development.

# User Preferences

# System Architecture
## UI/UX Decisions
The website implements a mobile-first responsive design, ensuring optimal viewing across various screen sizes. The design incorporates a professional aesthetic with features like a fixed navigation bar, dynamic content loading, and smooth scrolling. Interactive elements such as typewriter effects, scroll animations, and skill progress bars enhance user engagement. Professional modal systems are used for detailed service breakdowns and project information, featuring responsive design, hover effects, and clear pricing. The site also includes a professional headshot and authentic personal information for credibility.

## Technical Implementations
The project is structured as a Single Page Application (SPA) using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes modular JavaScript functions for various features, including navigation, animations, and form handling.

## Feature Specifications
Key features include:
- A comprehensive "Services & Solutions" section detailing AI workflow engineering, Python systems development, operations intelligence, data analysis, rapid web application development, and legacy system modernization.
- "Smart Solution Packages" offering bundled services and add-ons.
- An intelligent AI chatbot integrated with OpenAI GPT-3.5 (for Replit deployment) or a static response system (for GitHub Pages), providing conversational AI with context awareness and personality modeling.
- A dynamic projects section with detailed descriptions and image galleries.
- Achievements & Impact section showcasing measurable results.
- Professional certifications and endorsements.
- A contact form for inquiries.

## System Design Choices
The architecture is full-stack, with an HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend and a Node.js backend using Express.js and TypeScript. PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM is used for database integration. The system includes RESTful API endpoints for data operations, supporting features like contact form submissions and analytics tracking. The file structure is organized for clarity and maintainability, separating static assets, server logic, and database schemas. The project is designed for static hosting compatibility, allowing direct deployment of source files without a complex build process.
